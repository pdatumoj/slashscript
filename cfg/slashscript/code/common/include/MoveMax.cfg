//File: slashscript\code\common\include\MoveMax.cfg
//Summary: Implements movement with null-cancelling and forward/backward-releasing crouch jump mechanics



//Initialization:

//-Left and right null-cancelling buffers (the simplest case here)
alias "SlashComMoveResumeLeft" ""
alias "SlashComMoveResumeRight" ""

//-Uncrouching buffer (less simple, as it has jump integration)
alias "SlashComMoveResumeStand" "SlashComMoveMaybeUncrouch"

//-Uncrouching toggle state
alias "+SlashComMoveToggleCrouch" "SlashComMoveCrouchLock"
alias "-SlashComMoveToggleCrouch" ""

//-Forward and back null-cancelling buffers (these are used in jump-integrated operations)
alias "SlashComMoveResumeForward" ""
alias "SlashComMoveResumeBack" ""

//-Forward and back direction selection buffer (for the jump-integration)
alias "SlashComMoveResumeWhich" ""

//-Forward, back, and uncrouching authorization states (managed by the jumping operations)
alias "SlashComMoveMaybeForward" "+forward"
alias "SlashComMoveMaybeBack" "+back"
alias "SlashComMoveMaybeUncrouch" "-duck"



//Actions:

//-Null-cancelled left and right (rather vanilla)

//--Key down.  Stops opposing motion.  Starts new motion.  Buffers new motion.
alias "+SlashComMoveLeft" "-moveright; +moveleft; alias SlashComMoveResumeLeft +moveleft"
alias "+SlashComMoveRight" "-moveleft; +moveright; alias SlashComMoveResumeRight +moveright"

//--Key up.  Stops new motion.  Calls buffered motion, if present.  Flushes own buffer.
alias "-SlashComMoveLeft" "-moveleft; SlashComMoveResumeRight; alias SlashComMoveResumeLeft"
alias "-SlashComMoveRight" "-moveright; SlashComMoveResumeLeft; alias SlashComMoveResumeRight"

//-Jump-integrated contact-crouching - i.e. it won't uncrouch unless the jump code has authorized it

//--Key down.  Crouches.  Buffers current don't-uncrouch state.
alias "+SlashComMoveCrouch" "+duck; alias SlashComMoveResumeStand"

//--Key Up.  Attempts to uncrouch using jump-authorized-uncroucher
alias "-SlashComMoveCrouch" "SlashComMoveMaybeUncrouch; alias SlashComMoveResumeStand SlashComMoveMaybeUncrouch"

//-Toggling crouch wrapper

//--Key down (uncrouched state).  Triggers crouching code.
alias "SlashComMoveCrouchLock" "+SlashComMoveCrouch; alias +SlashComMoveToggleCrouch SlashComMoveCrouchUnlock"

//--Key down (crouched state).  Triggers uncrouching code.
alias "SlashComMoveCrouchUnlock" "-SlashComMoveCrouch; alias +SlashComMoveToggleCrouch SlashComMoveCrouchLock"

//-Null-cancelled forward and back operations (linked with jump mechanics)

//--Key down.  Stops opposing motion.  Attempts to start new motion (if jump code allows it).  Buffers currently desired motion state for new direction.  Buffers current motion direction.
alias "+SlashComMoveForward" "-back; SlashComMoveMaybeForward; alias SlashComMoveResumeForward SlashComMoveMaybeForward; alias SlashComMoveResumeWhich SlashComMoveResumeForward"
alias "+SlashComMoveBack" "-forward; SlashComMoveMaybeBack; alias SlashComMoveResumeBack SlashComMoveMaybeBack; alias SlashComMoveResumeWhich SlashComMoveResumeBack"

//--Key up.  Stops related motion.  Attempts to resume other motion (if jump code allows it).  Switches direction selection for jump integration.  Flushes own buffer.
alias "-SlashComMoveForward" "-forward; SlashComMoveResumeBack; alias SlashComMoveResumeWhich SlashComMoveResumeBack; alias SlashComMoveResumeForward"
alias "-SlashComMoveBack" "-back; SlashComMoveResumeForward; alias SlashComMoveResumeWhich SlashComMoveResumeForward; alias SlashComMoveResumeBack"

//-Jump operations

//--Key down.  Sets jump.  Sets crouch.  Stops any forward or back motion.  Clears forward, back, and uncrouch motion authorization buffers.
alias "+SlashComMoveJump" "+jump; +duck; -forward; -back; alias SlashComMoveMaybeForward; alias SlashComMoveMaybeBack; alias SlashComMoveMaybeUncrouch"

//--Key up.  Ends jump.  Grants forward and back motion authorizations.  Resumes forward or back motion, if relevant.  Grants uncrouch authorization.  Resumes uncrouch, if relevant.
alias "-SlashComMoveJump" "-jump; alias SlashComMoveMaybeForward +forward; alias SlashComMoveMaybeBack +back; SlashComMoveResumeWhich; alias SlashComMoveMaybeUncrouch -duck; SlashComMoveResumeStand"
